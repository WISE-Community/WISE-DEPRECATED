pages.research-tech.research.description=Header text for the research section of the WISE research and technology page
pages.research-tech.research_content=Emerging from research collaborations started over 20 years ago, the WISE Community develops instructional programs that use educational technology to help middle school and high school students master complex scientific concepts. This community consists of partnerships between teachers, educational researchers, practicing scientists, and technology experts. WISE projects and software are developed by researchers in the <a href="http://telscenter.org" target="_blank">Technology Enhanced Learning in Science (TELS) Community</a>.  The TELS Community includes partners at thirteen universities, a nonprofit educational research and development organization, and fifteen school districts. Local WISE teachers collaborate on research projects by providing their practitioner's perspective during annual summer retreats and teacher interviews.

pages.research-tech.ki=Knowledge Integration
pages.research-tech.ki.description=Header text for the Knowledge Integration section of the WISE research and technology page
pages.research-tech.ki_content=Students grapple with multiple, conflicting, and confusing ideas about science. WISE curriculum and technology development is driven by a rich research tradition that has shown that instruction is most effective when teachers use students' views as a starting point for scientific investigations. When teachers and instructional materials guide learners as they articulate their repertoire of ideas, add new ideas, sort out their ideas in a variety of contexts, and make connections at multiple levels of analysis, they develop more nuanced criteria for evaluating ideas, and, ultimately, formulate a linked set of views about scientific phenomena. TELS Director Marcia C. Linn characterizes this as the <span style="font-weight:bold">Knowledge Integration</span> framework and it forms the basis of WISE projects and assessments. (For more information, visit the <a href="http://telscenter.org" target="_blank">TELS website</a> and view our <a href="http://telscenter.org/publications" target="_blank">research publications</a>.)

pages.teacherfaq.shouldIRegisterStudentsQuestion=Should I register my students for WISE or have them do it themselves?
pages.teacherfaq.shouldIRegisterStudentsQuestion.description=The question Should I register my students for WISE or have them do it themselves?
pages.teacherfaq.shouldIRegisterStudentsAnswerPart1=WISE makes student registration simple and intuitive -- direct your student to the the WISE home page and provide them with their Access Code, and they should be able to register in 10 minutes or less.   However, you can also opt to pre-register all of your students and provide them with a copy of their Username/Password on their first day in the project run.
pages.teacherfaq.shouldIRegisterStudentsAnswerPart1.description=Part 1 of the answer to the question Should I register my students for WISE or have them do it themselves?

You can then go to the Grading link and edit the Point Values for each question.   For example, you could most steps in the project worth just 1-2 pts while a few key steps are worth 20 points.  Then tell your students they must complete all questions but should concentrate their efforts on the key questions.  We recognize that critically grading each step is very time consuming.

I have also started using exit tickets with questions from the project, so I can assess on a period to period basis where the misconceptions are... This helps me improve my teaching for the subsequent periods of the day as well as those classes the next day.

pages.wise-in-action.teacherProfileQuoteParagraph4=This is my seventh year using WISE, and I continue to learn. I have found it is harder to teach with inquiry because you need more time and patience. In the classroom, we seem to have less and less time. Even though it is sometimes harder, I feel that students take more control over their learning in the WISE inquiry projects and therefore it is more meaningful. Many of my colleagues have also started using WISE. It is wonderful to talk and discuss with my peers about runs. We come up with ideas about class instruction, grading of steps, and keeping students engaged in working with their partners."

For example, afterschool programs and home-school instructors teaching global climate change may want to use the WISE Global Climate Change's NetLogo model and associated prompts to allow students to experiment with different conditions.
