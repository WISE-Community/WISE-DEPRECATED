  <msg id="4250356526189572224"><source>app/privacy/privacy.component.html:61</source>We will not sell your information to anyone under any circumstances.</msg>
  <msg id="8633923265599353083"><source>app/privacy/privacy.component.html:62</source>The WISE team uses de-identified user data to perform research. Researchers in the Graduate School of Education at The University of California at Berkeley and partner institutions may use de-identified data to perform data analyses and explore research topics. This data includes both user-generated and auto-generated content (see &apos;Information We Collect&apos; section). Results of our research may be shared with educators and other researchers through conferences, journals, and other publications.</msg>
  <msg id="3061909762125005020"><source>app/privacy/privacy.component.html:63</source>When generating and analyzing research data, student names are removed from all student work and replaced with identification numbers. This process of replacing names with identification numbers is performed automatically by the WISE platform when exporting research data and will be performed by teachers if any other student work (e.g., from other instructional materials) is to be analyzed by researchers.</msg>
  <msg id="4786367828409317759"><source>app/privacy/privacy.component.html:64</source>Email addresses for teacher accounts are used for communication: (a) for support, and (b) for occasional public announcements from the WISE Team.

Each participating teacher will have access to his or her own students&apos; project work and will not be able to see any information from other teachers&apos; students. Teachers are also able to reset passwords for their students.</msg>
  <msg id="5573506795267128483"><source>app/privacy/privacy.component.html:66</source>A small set of WISE administrators are able to access user account information and data for support and technical purposes.

  <msg id="5894087928184389163"><source>app/help/teacher-faq/teacher-faq.component.html:40</source>WISE makes student registration simple and intuitive -- direct your students to the register page by having them go to the WISE home page and clicking the &quot;Register&quot; link at the upper right. They should be able to register in 10 minutes or less.
